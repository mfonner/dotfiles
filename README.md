# dotfiles
My dot files for Vim/Zsh/etc.

I'm currently using Oh My Zsh with iTerm for work and have migrated to Manjaro personal projects, though I try and keep the dotfiles as similar as possible.

I've also added my theme file for Windows Terminal which I'm using for WSL when I'm on Windows, and my zsh theme file.
