# dotfiles
My ever-changing dot files for Vim/Zsh/etc.

I'm currently using bash on WSL 2 running Ubuntu. My editor has also changed to [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/). It's easier to manage and I'm using it's default configuration as that's what my custom config for neovim basically did anyway.
