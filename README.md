# dotfiles
My dot files for Vim/Zsh/Bash/etc.

I'm currently using Oh My Zsh with iTerm for work and WSL for personal projects, though I try and keep the dotfiles as similar as possible.

Even though it's not really a standard dotfile, I did add my theme file for Windows Terminal which I'm using for WSL.
